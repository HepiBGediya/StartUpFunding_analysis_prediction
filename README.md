StartUpFunding_analysis_prediction using Python of 2015 to 2020

This paper shows the insights of funding done by startups and how growth changed with several factors. The aim of paper is to get a descriptive overview and a relationship pattern of funding and growth of newly launched startups. Another important point to understand how funding changes with time is an important aspect. Possible area of interests would be â€“ (Funding ecosystem and time relation, cities as a important factor, which industries, important investors). Dataset we are using contains information of funding of startups from January 2015 to August 2020.The amount invested is in USD. Aggregation of data w.r.t cities, investors, funding type etc. is required to get an optimized result. Here we done major preprocessing of data and overcome problem of missing data and uncertain distributions. Also, Visualizations are done to find the anomalies and mining patterns from data. It seems to be some cities showing some abnormal behavior when it comes to funding. Morever training and testing model is created for data prediction.
